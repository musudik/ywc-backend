üß† App Summary ‚Äì Backend (yourwealthcoach.de)
üîç Overview
yourwealthcoach.de is a financial coaching platform that connects Coaches with multiple Clients to manage their personal financial services. Each client can access multiple business modules such as real estate, insurance, loans, tax returns, and more. Coaches supervise their clients' progress and submissions through forms, file uploads, and automated exports.

The backend is designed as a modular, secure, scalable Node.js service, using Prisma ORM, Firebase for storage, and PostgreSQL as the primary database. It also includes scheduler jobs, integrations with third-party APIs, and advanced features like PDF/Excel exports, QR code generation, and chatbot integration.

===================================

CREATE USER yourwealthcoach WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'yourwealthcoach';
ALTER USER yourwealthcoach WITH SUPERUSER;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yourwealthcoach TO yourwealthcoach;
SELECT * FROM pg_user WHERE usename = 'yourwealthcoach';

‚úî Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.


Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
5. Tip: Explore how you can extend the ORM with scalable connection pooling, global caching, and real-time database events. Read: https://pris.ly/cli/beyond-orm

# YourWealthCoach Backend

Backend service for yourwealthcoach.de platform that connects Coaches with multiple Clients to manage their personal financial services.

## Authentication System

The authentication system is built using Firebase Authentication combined with a custom database layer using Prisma to store extended user information.

### Key Features

- Firebase Authentication for secure user management
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

### API Endpoints

#### Auth Routes

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify user's email
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Send password reset email
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/auth/firebase-webhook` - Firebase webhook endpoint

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User registers with email/password
   - A Firebase user is created
   - A corresponding user record is created in our database
   - Verification email is sent to the user

2. **Login**:
   - User logs in with Firebase Auth credentials
   - Firebase returns a JWT token
   - Frontend stores the token and sends it with subsequent requests

3. **Authorization**:
   - The `authenticate` middleware verifies the JWT token
   - User information is loaded from the database with role information
   - The `requireRole` middleware can be used to restrict access based on user roles

### Technical Implementation

- `AuthService`: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management
- `AuthController`: Exposes API endpoints for authentication operations
- `authenticate` middleware: Verifies JWT tokens and loads user information
- `requireAuth` middleware: Ensures the user is authenticated
- `requireRole` middleware: Restricts access based on user roles
